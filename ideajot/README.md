IDEAJOT

I created this CRUD application by following a tutorial from Brad Traversy in his Node, MongoDB, and Express Udemy course, which I highly recommend.

The website allows users to register, login, and create idea cards which can be edited or deleted. 

The bootstrap theme I used is from bootswatch.
